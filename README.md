# kagglecomp-regression-abalone

This repository contains codes for kaggle competitions. This competition uses regression techniques to predict the age of abalone.

I used techniques like XGBoost, CatBoost, LightBGM and tried stacking them all using StackingRegressor. Even though I used 3 methods and tried to stack them all, I consider my work not so perfect because I only placed 1000 ~2000 positions.

Code improvisation can be done by preprocessing the data in more depth and tuning hyperparameters correctly.
